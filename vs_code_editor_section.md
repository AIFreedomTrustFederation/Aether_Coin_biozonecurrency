## Integrated VS Code Editor

Aetherion includes a built-in VS Code-like editor for smart contract development directly within the application. This integration features:

- Monaco Editor for code editing with syntax highlighting
- Terminal at the bottom of the editor for running commands
- Collapsible file explorer on the left side
- Full mobile responsiveness on small screens
- Support for Solidity and other blockchain development languages

The editor is accessible through the "Code Editor" section in the application navigation and offers a seamless development experience similar to a desktop IDE. The layout has been optimized with the terminal positioned at the bottom and a collapsible file explorer to maximize screen real estate, especially on mobile devices.
