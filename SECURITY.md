# Security Practices for Aetherion Wallet

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for the Aetherion Wallet application.

## Security Features

The Aetherion Wallet application implements the following security features:

### 1. HTTP Security Headers

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts which resources can be loaded and executed
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides protection against cross-site scripting attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling iframe embedding
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls the information sent in the Referer header
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts which browser features can be used

### 2. API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting request frequency
- **CSRF Protection**: Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks
- **Input Validation**: Validates all user input using Zod schemas
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure API key validation and management
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with httpOnly and secure cookies

### 3. Data Security

- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage using bcrypt
- **Constant-Time Comparisons**: Prevents timing attacks
- **Secure Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random values
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate user input using the provided validation schemas
   - Never trust client-side data without server-side validation

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use the provided authentication middleware
   - Implement proper authorization checks for all sensitive operations
   - Never hardcode credentials or secrets

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use the provided error handling middleware
   - Never expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive data

4. **Database Operations**
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Validate and sanitize all database inputs
   - Implement proper access controls for database operations

5. **File Operations**
   - Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
   - Use secure file storage practices
   - Never trust user-provided filenames or paths

6. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions to prevent supply chain attacks

### For Administrators

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
   - Never commit .env files to version control
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Deployment Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all production deployments
   - Configure proper firewall rules
   - Implement proper access controls for server access

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
   - Implement proper alerting for security events
   - Regularly review access logs

4. **Incident Response**
   - Have a documented incident response plan
   - Regularly test backup and recovery procedures
   - Have a communication plan for security incidents

## Security Audit

The application includes a security audit script that can be run to identify potential security issues:

```bash
npm run security:audit
```

This script checks for:
- Hardcoded secrets
- Insecure dependencies
- Missing security headers
- Insecure configurations
- Missing input validation

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue. Email security@aifreedomtrust.com instead.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as needed. It is recommended to:

1. Subscribe to security notifications
2. Regularly update the application
3. Run security audits after each update
