\section*{Abstract}
This white paper presents the Recursive IUL Cascade Framework, a structured strategy that transforms a single \$4,500 investment into a \$1,000,000 tax-free cash value portfolio within five years—designed specifically for households with limited capital. Using Indexed Universal Life (IUL) insurance, the system recycles policy loans to create a network of self-growing policies, each earning 7--9\% annually while borrowing at 4--6\%. This arbitrage, paired with careful compliance to Modified Endowment Contract (MEC) rules, builds wealth through compounding and policy replication—no additional out-of-pocket funds required after the initial seed. The result is a scalable, self-funding engine offering tax-free income, living benefits, and legacy protection for families starting with little.

\section{Implementation Blueprint}

\subsection*{Initial Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Seed Premium: \$4,500
    \item Loan-to-Value (LTV): 70\%
    \item Effective Annual Return: 6\% (conservative base; 7--9\% optimal)
    \item Loan Rate: 6\% (conservative; 4--6\% optimal)
    \item Loan Cycle: Monthly (Year 1), Quarterly (Years 2--5)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Concept Walkthrough}
\textit{Think of this strategy as building a chain of interest-earning accounts. You start with one, then use a portion of its value to fund others. Each new account also earns interest and contributes to growing your overall wealth—like multiplying money without using new cash after the first step.}

\subsection*{Year-by-Year Breakdown}

\subsubsection*{Year 1: Initial Seeding}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Policy P$_1$ is funded with \$4,500. After one month of 0.5\% growth, it reaches \$4,522. You borrow 70\% of that—\$3,150—to start Policy P$_2$.
    \item By Month 5, Policy P$_1$ has grown to \$4,653 and Policy P$_2$ to \$3,223. With nearly \$8,000 combined, you borrow again to create Policy P$_3$.
    \item Year 1 ends with three active policies and over \$13,000 in combined cash value.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Concept Walkthrough}
\textit{You're taking calculated loans against growing assets to build more of those same assets. This is like reinvesting early profits from a business into opening new branches—with all of them earning revenue independently.}
