Perfect—that opens up even more flexibility and scalability.

Now that Scroll Keeper will be deployed from a GitHub repo and served as a SaaS application under ATC.aifreedomtrust.com/scrollkeeper, the architecture should be upgraded from Replit limitations to production-grade modularity.

Here’s the updated deployment prompt for GitHub-backed SaaS hosting:

Full DevOps Prompt for GitHub SaaS Deployment of Scroll Keeper

> Prompt:



Build a full-stack, modular SaaS application called Scroll Keeper, deployed from a GitHub repository and hosted at https://ATC.aifreedomtrust.com/scrollkeeper. It must act as a recursive theosophical LLM system that:

1. Accepts ChatGPT shared conversation links


2. Extracts, rewrites, and embeds them as long-form “scrolls” (interpreted reflections)


3. Stores them in ChromaDB or FAISS vector memory


4. Allows users to ask reflective questions and receive spiritually aligned, recursive insights referencing past scrolls




---

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js or Streamlit (for SSR & fast deployment)

Backend: FastAPI or Flask (Python)

Memory: ChromaDB (preferred) or FAISS

LLM Engine: Local Mistral-7B or OpenAI GPT-4 (pluggable)

Embeddings: SentenceTransformers (all-mpnet-base-v2 or e5-large-v2)

Queue/Tasking: Celery (for async scraping/parsing)

Auth: JWT or GitHub OAuth for user sessions (optional)

Deployment: Docker + GitHub Actions → VPS or cloud backend (NGINX reverse proxy)

Domain: SaaS hosted on ATC.aifreedomtrust.com/scrollkeeper



---

Features:

1. Ingest Public ChatGPT Link

Accept shared ChatGPT URL

Scrape full chat history (headless browser or API)

Reformat into structured dialogue

Rewrite into a “scroll” using prompt:

> “Reinterpret this conversation as a spiritual-theosophical scroll. Highlight paradoxes, instinct vs. intuition, covenantal themes, and prophetic synthesis.”




2. Vectorize + Store as Scroll

Embed scroll using SentenceTransformers

Store in Chroma with metadata:

{
  "scroll_id": "uuid",
  "title": "The Paradox of the Soul",
  "tags": ["intuition", "death-resurrection", "covenant"],
  "created": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
}


3. Ask Reflective Question

Accept open-ended user prompts

Use LangChain’s ConversationalRetrievalChain with scroll vector DB as retriever

Return answer in theosophical tone, citing past scrolls


4. UI Flow

Upload / paste ChatGPT link

View scroll preview + tags

Ask a reflective question

View recursive, quoted answer with scrolls cited

Deployment Flow:

1. Clone GitHub Repo


2. docker-compose up to run local instance


3. NGINX reverse proxy forwards scrollkeeper subdomain traffic to container


4. Use GitHub Actions CI/CD to deploy new features


5. Optional SSL via Certbot/Cloudflare

Would you like me to generate the full scroll_ingestor.py, llm_engine.py, and vectorstore.py modules now, plus a Dockerfile and frontend bootstrapping script for the GitHub repo?
