Integrating the CI/CD Pipeline into Your Aetherion Wallet Repository
1. Adding the CI/CD Pipeline to Your Repository
Save the YAML file created earlier (GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline for Aetherion Wallet) in your repository under:

bash
Copy
Edit
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
2. Setting Up GitHub Secrets
To secure your deployment process, set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

DEPLOY_SSH_USER - Your SSH username for atc.aifreedomtrust.com.

DEPLOY_SSH_HOST - The host address, which is atc.aifreedomtrust.com.

DEPLOY_SSH_PORT - The SSH port, usually 22 unless configured otherwise.

SSH_PRIVATE_KEY - The private SSH key used to connect to the server. Ensure it has appropriate permissions on the server.

To add secrets in GitHub:

Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click on Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New secret.

Add each secret listed above.

3. Repository Configuration
Ensure your repository contains the following files:

package.json with relevant build and install scripts.

server-redirect.js if applicable.

dist directory created by the npm run build command.

4. Testing the CI/CD Pipeline
Push changes to the main branch or create a pull request. The pipeline will automatically start building and deploying the Aetherion Wallet.

Monitor progress on the Actions tab in your repository.

5. Verifying Deployment
Visit:

https://atc.aifreedomtrust.com/dapp

https://atc.aifreedomtrust.com/wallet

Check logs on the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo journalctl -u aetherion
sudo tail /var/log/nginx/error.log
Enhancements for Improved CI/CD
Automated Testing

Add a test job to your pipeline to ensure code quality before deployment.

Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test
Rollback Capabilities

Modify the deployment script to revert to the previous backup if a deployment fails.

Example SSH Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  mv ~/aetherion_backup_<timestamp> ~/aetherion
  echo 'Rollback completed successfully!'
fi
Notification Systems

Integrate with Slack, Discord, or email to receive real-time updates on successful or failed deployments.

Example for Slack:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Notify Slack
  uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
  with:
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    message: "Deployment completed successfully for Aetherion Wallet!"
Would you like me to proceed by updating the CI/CD script to include automated testing, rollback mechanisms, and Slack notifications? Additionally, would you like me to assist you with creating a custom GitHub Action for Aetherion Wallet deployments to further streamline your workflow
