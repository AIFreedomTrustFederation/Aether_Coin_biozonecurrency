## Mobile-Specific Considerations

The VS Code editor in Aetherion has been specifically optimized for mobile devices. When deploying, keep these considerations in mind:

### Mobile Layout

- **Responsive Design**: The editor automatically adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Terminal Placement**: Terminal is positioned at the bottom for better thumb access on mobile
- **Collapsible Panels**: File explorer and other panels can be collapsed to maximize editor space
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Larger touch targets for buttons and controls
- **Adaptive Toolbar**: Icon-only toolbar on small screens, full labels on larger screens

### Testing Mobile Experience

Before deployment, test the application on various mobile devices to ensure:

1. Code editor loads properly and is responsive
2. Terminal is usable on touch screens
3. File explorer toggle works correctly
4. Virtual keyboard doesn't obstruct critical UI elements
5. Touch interactions work as expected

### Mobile Performance Optimizations

The deployment includes mobile-specific optimizations:

- Delayed loading of non-critical editor features
- Optimized rendering for mobile devices
- Touch event handling for better mobile interaction
- Virtual keyboard detection and UI adjustment
