# Tailwind CSS Fix

This document explains how to fix the "Unknown at rule @tailwind" error in your project.

## Quick Fix

1. We've created a temporary solution by:
   - Creating a `tailwind-output.css` file with pre-compiled Tailwind styles
   - Modifying `index.css` to import this file instead of using Tailwind directives

2. This should resolve the immediate error, but for a proper setup, follow the steps below.

## Proper Setup

### Option 1: Generate Tailwind CSS with the provided script

1. Run the following command in the client directory:

   ```bash
   node generate-tailwind.js
   ```

2. This will generate the `tailwind-output.css` file with all the Tailwind styles.

3. You'll need to run this command whenever you make changes to your Tailwind configuration.

### Option 2: Set up Tailwind CSS properly with your build tool

1. If you're using Vite, make sure you have a `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts` file with the following configuration:

   ```javascript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
   import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
   import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [
       react(),
       tailwindcss(),
     ],
   });
   ```

2. Make sure your `postcss.config.cjs` file is properly configured:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     plugins: {
       tailwindcss: {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     },
   };
   ```

3. Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` file is properly set up (which it appears to be).

4. Then you can use the Tailwind directives in your CSS files:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to see the "Unknown at rule @tailwind" error:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Check if your IDE's CSS language server is properly configured to recognize Tailwind directives.

3. Try restarting your development server.

4. If using VS Code, install the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension.
