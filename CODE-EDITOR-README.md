# VS Code Editor Integration

## Overview

The Aetherion Wallet includes a fully-featured VS Code-like editor for smart contract development, built using the Monaco Editor. This editor provides an integrated development environment within the wallet application, allowing users to write, test, and deploy smart contracts without leaving the platform.

## Features

### Core Editor Features

- **Monaco Editor**: The same editor that powers VS Code
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Support for Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more
- **IntelliSense**: Code completion and suggestions
- **Error Detection**: Real-time code validation
- **Multi-file Support**: Work with multiple files simultaneously
- **Terminal Integration**: Command-line terminal at the bottom of the editor
- **File Explorer**: Sidebar for file management with collapsible functionality

### Mobile Optimization

The editor is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices:

- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Toggle the file explorer to maximize screen space
- **Terminal Placement**: Terminal positioned at the bottom for better mobile experience
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Optimized for touch interaction
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Virtual Keyboard Awareness**: UI adjusts when virtual keyboard appears

### Development Features

- **Solidity Compilation**: Compile smart contracts within the editor
- **Deployment Tools**: Deploy contracts to test networks
- **Transaction Simulation**: Test contract functionality without actual deployment
- **Gas Estimation**: Estimate gas costs for contract deployment and method calls
- **ABI Generation**: Automatically generate ABIs from contracts

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The VS Code editor integration is organized into these main components:

- `CodeEditor.tsx`: Core Monaco editor component
- `CodeEditorPage.tsx`: Page component that hosts the editor
- `Terminal.tsx`: Interactive terminal component
- `FileExplorer.tsx`: File navigation and management
- `EditorToolbar.tsx`: Editor actions and controls

### Mobile Responsiveness

The mobile implementation follows these design principles:

1. **Terminal at Bottom**: Positioned for optimal mobile viewing
2. **Collapsible Panels**: Toggle file explorer with a button
3. **Adaptive UI**: Interface elements resize based on screen dimensions
4. **Touch Optimizations**: Larger touch targets and swipe gestures
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Some UI elements appear only on larger screens

### Technical Specifications

- **Monaco Editor**: Version 0.44.0 or higher
- **Terminal Implementation**: Uses xterm.js for terminal emulation
- **File System Interface**: Custom implementation for managing file operations
- **Compiler Integration**: Web-based Solidity compiler
- **Deployment Interface**: Web3 integration for contract deployment

## Usage Instructions

### Opening the Editor

1. Navigate to the "Code Editor" section in the main application menu
2. The editor will load with a default welcome file

### File Management

1. Use the file explorer on the left to navigate between files
2. Click the toggle button to collapse or expand the file explorer
3. Right-click in the explorer for file actions (New, Delete, Rename)

### Using the Terminal

1. The terminal is located at the bottom of the editor
2. Use standard command-line instructions
3. Run compilation and deployment commands directly in the terminal

### Mobile-Specific Tips

1. Double-tap the editor to focus and open the virtual keyboard
2. Use the collapse button to maximize editor space on small screens
3. Rotate to landscape mode for more comfortable coding on mobile
4. Use pinch-to-zoom for better code visibility

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The editor supports many standard VS Code keyboard shortcuts:

- `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`: Save current file
- `Ctrl+Space`: Trigger suggestions
- `F1`: Open command palette
- `Ctrl+\` / `Cmd+\`: Toggle terminal visibility
- `Ctrl+B` / `Cmd+B`: Toggle file explorer

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the VS Code editor integration:

1. Enhanced debugging capabilities
2. Integration with version control systems
3. Additional language support beyond Solidity
4. Collaborative editing features
5. Extended mobile gesture support
