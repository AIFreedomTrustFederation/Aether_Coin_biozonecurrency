# Transaction Security Module

## Overview

The Transaction Security module provides comprehensive protection for blockchain transactions on the Aetherion platform. It offers real-time risk assessment, phishing detection, and security monitoring features to ensure safe and secure cryptocurrency transfers.

## Key Features

- **Transaction Analysis**: Evaluate transactions for potential risks before execution
- **Phishing Detection**: Identify and warn about potential phishing attempts
- **Risk Assessment**: Score transactions based on multiple risk factors
- **Security Rules**: Customizable security rules for transaction validation
- **Address Reputation**: Check recipient addresses against known risky addresses
- **Security Alerts**: Generate alerts for suspicious activity
- **Security Dashboard**: Monitor wallet security health in real-time

## Components

- `TransactionAnalyzer`: Core utility for transaction risk assessment
- `PhishingDetector`: Detection of phishing attempts and scams
- `SecurityDashboard`: UI component for security monitoring
- `TransactionMonitor`: Real-time transaction security monitoring

## Usage

```jsx
import { 
  SecurityDashboard, 
  SecurityProvider 
} from '@/modules/transaction-security';

// Wrap your app in the provider
function MyApp() {
  return (
    <SecurityProvider initialSecurityLevel="standard">
      <AppContent />
    </SecurityProvider>
  );
}

// Use the security dashboard in a component
function WalletDashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Wallet Dashboard</h1>
      <SecurityDashboard userId={1} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

The Transaction Security module can be configured with the following settings:

- `securityLevel`: Security strictness level (standard, high, paranoid)
- `holdingPeriod`: Transaction holding period for potential reversal
- Custom security rules and thresholds
- Whitelist and blacklist settings for addresses

## Hooks

- `useSecurity()`: Access security state and methods

## Integration with Other Modules

The Transaction Security module integrates with:

- **AI Assistant Module**: For intelligent risk analysis and recommendations
- **Escrow Module**: For holding suspicious transactions during review
- **Notification Module**: For alerting users about security threats

## API Interface

The security system interacts with backend services via API endpoints for:

- Transaction risk analysis
- Phishing URL detection
- Address reputation checks
- Security rule evaluation

All security features are powered by quantum-resistant cryptography to protect against both current and future threats.
