# Microservices Architecture & CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

This document outlines the microservices architecture and CI/CD pipeline configuration for the platform-agnostic Scroll Keeper system. The architecture is designed to be modular, extensible, and deployable in various environments.

## Microservices Structure

### Core Services

1. **API Gateway Service**
   - Path: `/api-gateway/`
   - Purpose: Entry point for all API requests, handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting
   - Technology: Express.js, API Management Tools

2. **Auth Service**
   - Path: `/auth-service/`
   - Purpose: Handles authentication, credential management, and user sessions
   - Technology: Auth Providers, JWT, Secure Storage

3. **Extraction Service**
   - Path: `/extraction-service/`
   - Purpose: Handles all conversation extraction logic from various sources
   - Technology: API clients, HTML parsing, data normalization

4. **Storage Service**
   - Path: `/storage-service/`
   - Purpose: Provides abstraction for data storage, vector search, and retrieval
   - Technology: Database adapters, vector embeddings, caching

5. **UI Service**
   - Path: `/ui-service/`
   - Purpose: Serves the client-side application
   - Technology: React, WebSockets for real-time updates

### Supporting Services

1. **Monitoring Service**
   - Path: `/monitoring-service/`
   - Purpose: Collects metrics, traces, and logs from all services
   - Technology: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

2. **Notification Service**
   - Path: `/notification-service/`
   - Purpose: Handles all user notifications and events
   - Technology: Message queues, email/SMS integrations

## Service Communication

- RESTful APIs for service-to-service communication
- Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for event-driven architecture
- WebSockets for real-time client updates

## CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

### Build Pipeline

- Each microservice has an isolated build pipeline
- Shared libraries handled by package management
- Dependency scanning and vulnerability checks
- Containerization (Docker) for consistent environments

### Test Pipeline

- Unit testing specific to each microservice
- Integration testing for service interfaces
- End-to-end testing across service boundaries
- Performance and load testing

### Deployment Pipeline

- Multi-environment strategy (dev, staging, production)
- Blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Automatic rollback on failure detection
- Configuration management via environment variables and secrets

## CI/CD Tools Integration

- GitHub Actions for automated workflows
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration (optional)
- Terraform for infrastructure as code (optional)

## Development Workflow

1. Feature branches created from main/develop
2. Automated testing on pull requests
3. Code review and approval process
4. Automated deployment to dev environment
5. Manual promotion to staging
6. Automated canary testing
7. Manual promotion to production

## Monitoring and Observability

- Centralized logging
- Distributed tracing
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics and dashboards
