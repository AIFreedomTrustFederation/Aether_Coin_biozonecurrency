# GitHub CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide for Aetherion Wallet

This document provides instructions for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for the Aetherion Wallet application.

## 1. Create GitHub Actions Workflow File

Create the file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

- Main trigger events: push to main branch, pull requests, manual trigger
- Jobs: test, build, deploy
- Features: automated testing, artifact management, backup/rollback, deployment verification, notifications

## 2. Setting Up GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

- DEPLOY_SSH_USER - Your SSH username for atc.aifreedomtrust.com
- DEPLOY_SSH_HOST - The host address (atc.aifreedomtrust.com)
- DEPLOY_SSH_PORT - The SSH port (usually 22)
- SSH_PRIVATE_KEY - Private SSH key used to connect to the server
- SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL - Webhook URL for Slack notifications (optional)

## 3. Key Features of the CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated Testing: Runs tests before deployment
- Artifact Management: Packages application for deployment
- Backup & Rollback: Creates backups and includes rollback mechanisms
- Deployment Verification: Checks if deployment was successful
- Slack Notifications: Sends notifications about deployment status

## 4. Workflow Process

1. Test Stage:
   - Checkout code
   - Install dependencies
   - Run tests

2. Build Stage:
   - Build the application
   - Create deployment package
   - Upload as artifact

3. Deploy Stage:
   - Setup SSH connection
   - Backup existing deployment
   - Upload and extract package
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure and restart service
   - Verify deployment
   - Send notifications

## 5. Additional Customizations
