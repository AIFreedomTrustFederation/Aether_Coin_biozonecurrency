# PR Summary: Migrate from Lovable Template to Biozone Template

This PR replaces the existing "lovable" template with the new Biozone template for the AetherCore ecosystem. The new template provides a cosmic-inspired design that better aligns with the project's vision, featuring redshift-blueshift elements converging to greenshift.

- `src/App.tsx` - Updated main App component with ThemeProvider
- `src/App.css` - Added custom styles with quantum effects and cosmic shift animations
- `src/index.css` - Updated Tailwind configuration with redshift-blueshift-greenshift color variables
- `src/main.tsx` - Updated React rendering
- `theme.json` - Enhanced theme with redshift (#ff5500), blueshift (#3b00ff), and greenshift (#19c964) colors

### New Components
- `src/components/theme-provider.tsx` - Theme management with dark/light mode support
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Responsive navigation with convergence text effect
