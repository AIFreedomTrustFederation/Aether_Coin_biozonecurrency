# Migration Plan Implementation Report

## Overview

This document outlines the steps taken to implement the migration from the `clean_fixes_20250410_163230` branch to the `main` branch, focusing on migrating the CodeStar (formerly Codester) and ScrollKeeper components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Files Created/Adapted

- **ScrollKeeperHighlight.tsx**: Modified to use Wouter for routing instead of React Router DOM
- **CodeStarPage.tsx**: Modified to use Wouter for routing
- **ScrollKeeperPage.tsx**: Modified to use Wouter for routing

### 2. Server Configuration

- **server-proxy.js**: Enhanced with WebSocket support for real-time features in ScrollKeeper
- **server.js**: Simple entry point that imports and runs server-proxy.js

### 3. Routing Changes

- **App.tsx**: Updated to use Wouter's routing system instead of React Router DOM
  - Changed `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route` with `element` props to Wouter's `Switch`, `Route` with `component` props
  - Removed unnecessary BrowserRouter wrapper
  - Added all routes following Wouter's format

### 4. Integration

- Added `/codestar` and `/scroll-keeper` routes to the server configuration
- Enhanced the server with WebSocket support for potential real-time collaborative features

## Technical Approach

### Router Migration

The main technical change was migrating from React Router DOM to Wouter. Key differences:

1. **Component Prop vs Element Prop**: 
   - React Router: `<Route path="/path" element={<Component />} />`
   - Wouter: `<Route path="/path" component={Component} />`

2. **Router Structure**:
   - React Router: Uses `BrowserRouter` and `Routes` as wrappers
   - Wouter: Simplified with just `Switch` as a wrapper for `Route` components

3. **Link Component**:
   - Both libraries provide a `Link` component, but with slightly different props

### WebSocket Enhancement

Added WebSocket server capability to the Express server to enable real-time features:

1. Created a WebSocket server on the same HTTP server but a different path (/ws)
2. Implemented a basic message handling system
3. Set up client connection/disconnection logging

## Future Steps

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all routes and components
2. **Deployment**: Configure GitHub Actions workflow for deploying from main branch
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new branch strategy
4. **Training**: Ensure team members understand the new workflow

## Migration Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single branch as source of truth
2. **Enhanced Features**: Real-time capabilities via WebSocket
3. **Modern Routing**: Lighter-weight routing with Wouter
4. **Improved Collaboration**: Better CodeStar and ScrollKeeper integration into the main application
